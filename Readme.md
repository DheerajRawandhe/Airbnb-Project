  # My Airbnb Project
This is My Airbnb Project!
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular platform Airbnb.
The main purpose of this project is to practice and learn how real-world websites work from backend to frontend.
In this project, users can create an account, log in, and list their properties for rent.
Other users can search for different types of properties based on location, category, and availability.
They can view detailed information about each property like price, description, and amenities.

It is a complete project that looks and feels like a real Airbnb website.
Working on this project improved my skills in frontend, backend, database management, and responsive web design.
